<h1>Hangman</h1>
<p>This assignment was mainly working within react to create frontend logic to allow for a user to play a hangman game, and dynamically update the hangman pictures.</p>
<p>The game starts with an account user being set which at the end of the game would potentially be added to a highscores board.</p><img width="449" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 2 55 21 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b6a94ab-cea1-4e25-bc48-91d18aead185">
<p>Once your user was set you would find yourself at the actually game itself found below. Again, due to mongo difficulties, i will not be able to show the full functionality of the game, however upon entering an incorrect character you're game would update, show the incorrect character added and the hangman picture would update. Some of the code for this is shown below.</p>

<p>This is how i was able to make the hangman image progress, with a variable up above that changed based on the amount of incorrect guesses.</p>
<p>The highscore page will look pretty unimpressive as all of the users and their highscores are pulled from mongo.</p>
<p>I do not remember any real troubles with this assignment, the frontend portion was fairly easy and what i mainly worked on</p>
