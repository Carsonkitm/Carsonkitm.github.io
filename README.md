    The purpose of the banking app project was to get a working MERN project that allowed for specific users to have different options within the project depending on their role. At a high level the banking app is just as you'd expect. An app to track your finances within different accounts, as well as allowing for transfering, depositing, and withdrawing from said accounts.

    I feel that the biggest struggle by far with this assignment was getting the sessions to work. Luckily <a href="https://github.com/SophiaAHeatonWeberState">Sophia</a> was able to figure out what i was doing wrong with the sessions.

<h3><a href="./CS-3750-Hangman" >Hangman App</a></h3>

    I quite enjoyed creating the hangman game. I hadnt used a ton of REACT or really much frontend development at this point. It was definetely a little bit lackluster, but creating the dynamic hangman a fun project. I did most of the frontend for this specific assignment with <a href="https://github.com/joshjosh0424">Josh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SophiaAHeatonWeberState">Sophia</a> handling the main backend portions. As well as the username.
  </p>
  <p>
    The biggest hurdle for me in this assignment was just working in the frontend. Web dev in general is not something that i'm naturally attracted to, mainly because of the frontend design decisions. Therefore i was a quite adverse to actually working on the main game functionality, until i got into it. The game logic was quite a fun portion to work on.

    This was another project similar to the hangman game where most of my time was spent on the game logic in the frontend. Simlarly to the rest of the projects in this repo it was all done with different stages of the MERN stack. This one was pretty straightforward. We followed a guide online as a class to get us introduced to the way that MERN can work. Although this didnt include Mongo or a backend.

<h3><a href="./mongo-e" >Mongo Introduction</a></h3>

    This project acted as a mongo db introduction. We used mongo and node routes to fetch different users which had different attributes such as name, position, level, etc... The main functionality was to be able to add, delete, and edit different users within the front end. Unfortunately, we deleted the mongo store, and i lost connection due to another student "owning" the db. However this is the what the frontend looked like.
