<h1>Banking App</h1>
<p>
  Like the introduction says, this is project acts as a banking app. Which allows for transfers, withdrawals, and deposits like any other banking app should. We also implemented sessions to work with this app to allow for different users with different roles and account amounts to function within the app.

  As shown above the user starts with a login page that will verify if the account exists, if not it will send an error message stating that there is no matching account with these credentials. At that point you are directed to the account page as should below. Unfortunately, due to another student owning the mongodb, i am unable to pull the actual data from mongo, as it seems my ip/security within mongo has expired. This will be a reocurring theme within these projects. See the account page below.

<p>Within this page you will see your account balances as well as options to withdraw, deposit, and transfer between these accounts. You should also see a welcome message at the top showing the currently signed in user.</p>

<p>Here you will notice that you can change the accounts to transfer from and to, with accurate amounts next to each account.</p>
<p>If you are a verified account type, ie employee or administrator you also have access to the account creation page, where you can assign name, number, and account role for a new user. This will not be shown to customers</p>

<p>I would say that the greatest struggle that we faced was getting the sessions to work with the assignment, a feature we found was not necessary at the point in which we were trying to get it to work. Luckily one of the members of our group was able to make this function</p>
